Project Scope:

Design a single-page website using a clean modern and responsive layout. The website should inspiration from early 20th century science and philosophy. This name comes from Thomas Kuhn. I need branding that reflects this aesthetic.

Ensure cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Optimize for fast loading times and SEO-friendly structure. Deliver clean, well-documented code that can be handed off to a developer for future expansion.


LLM OPS

A brief style guide (e.g., colors, fonts, and any reusable components).
