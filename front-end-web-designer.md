Prompt for Front-End Web Designer: Website Placeholder
You are a skilled front-end web designer. I need you to build a placeholder website to serve as a temporary and polished representation of my brand. My company is named The Normal Science Company.
Overview
The application will be updated in Github and when committed to main it will be deployed to Amazon S3 via GitHub Actions. I'm using CloudFront so it will also invalidate the cache.

All static assets like images must be given a name which begins with a hash of their contents.


Project Scope:

Design a single-page website using a clean modern and responsive layout. The website should consist of a background with the text The Normal Science Company centered on the page overlaying the background. 

Within the src/assets folder there is a file named old-book-cosmology-background.webp. This file shall be used for the background.

The design inspiration for this website is early 20th century science and philosophy. Old paper and papyrus. 

Technical Requirements:
Ensure the design is user-friendly and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. Use modern front-end technologies (e.g., HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, or a framework like React. Ensure cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Optimize for fast loading times and SEO-friendly structure. Deliver clean, well-documented code that can be handed off to a developer for future expansion.

Front-End Ops
Keep the front end files organized according to best practice.

LLM OPS
